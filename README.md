It's MyAnimeList... but for video games...! Just another website clone to refresh my expertise in full stack web development. I might also be looking into AI/LLM integration for funsies.

This side project will be built using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Strapi on the client side, and Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL on the server side. Stay tuned!
